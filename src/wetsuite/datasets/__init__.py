'''
Fetch and load already-created datasets that we provide. (to see a list of actual datasets, look for the wetsuite_datasets.ipynb notebook)

As this is often structured data, each dataset may work a little differently, 
so there is an describe() to get you started, that each dataset should fill out.

CONSIDER:
  - "treat collections of files as datasets?" or is that your own responsibility
    ...i.e. more of a notebook "how to deal with pdf, odt, and make that a thing to iterate through"


TODO: 
  - decide how often to re-fetch the index client-side. 
    Each interpreter (which is what it does right now)?   
    Store and base on mtime with possible override? 
    Decide it's cheap enough to fetch each time? (but fall back onto stored?)
  - decide how to store and access. For very large datasets we may want something like HDF5 
    because right now we don't have a choice but to have all the dataset in RAM
